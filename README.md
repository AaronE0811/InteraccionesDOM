## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Display flex
- JS



### What I learned


- I learned how to implement **modals** that appear when clicking the **Submit** button and disappear when clicking outside of them.  
- I practiced how to toggle the **active class** on rating buttons, so the selected option stays highlighted until the modal is closed.  
- I understood the difference between CSS pseudo‑classes like `:hover` and `:active`, and how to use a persistent `.active` class with JavaScript to control styles dynamically.  
- I reinforced the use of **event listeners** in JavaScript to handle user interactions (click events) and update the DOM accordingly.
